Main class in TestShape.java

Created constructors for Points and shapes.
created an abstract parent class "Shape" and child classes "Rectangle", "Triangle", and "Quadrilateral".

more shapes can be added similarly without changing the rest of the code.
commonly used functions like "distance between two points" are defined in the parent branch "Shape", so they can be used by every other class.
